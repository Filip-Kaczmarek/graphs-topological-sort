# graphs-topological-sort
A topological sort can be performed only when the graph is a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph).
This program reads an adjacency list of a graph from an input.
Then a user can choose whether to choose an adjacency matrix or a graph matrix to execute a topological sort of the vertices.
If you choose the adjacency matrix, there are 2 algorithms to sort topologically:
  1. Kahn's algorithm - sorting with removal of independent vertices
  2. Algorithm using the DFS (Depth First Search) procedure
